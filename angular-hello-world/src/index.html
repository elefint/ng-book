<!--The app-root tag is where our application will be rendered.

But what is the app-root tag and where does it come from?
app-root is a component that is defined by our Angular application.
In Angular we can define our own HTML tags and give them custom functionality.
The app-root tag will be the “entry point” for our application on the page.-->
